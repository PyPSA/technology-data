The total cost are driven by material and working time on the tanks.
While the costs do not scale strictly linearly, we here assume they do (good approximation c.f. ref. Fig 55.) and take the costs for a 9 kt NH3 (l) tank = 8 M$2010, which is smaller 4-5x smaller than the largest deployed tanks today.
