# technologydata: Techno-economic assumptions for energy models

`technologydata` is a Python package that supports the management of techno-economic assumptions for energy system models.
It provides a structured way to store, retrieve, and manipulate data related to various technologies used in energy systems,
including unit-ful parameters, currency conversions, inflation adjustment, and temporal modelling.

The goal of this package is to make energy system modelling easier and more efficient,
automating common tasks and transformations to reduce errors and allowing for easier data exchange between models.
