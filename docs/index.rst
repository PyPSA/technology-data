This script compiles assumptions on energy system technologies (such as costs, efficiencies, lifetimes, etc.) for chosen years (e.g. [2020, 2030, 2050]) from a variety
of sources into CSV files to be read by energy system modelling software. The merged outputs have standardized cost years, technology names, units and source information.
