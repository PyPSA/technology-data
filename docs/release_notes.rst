    + Do not take value from DEA which is more focues on integrated Power-To-Liquid plant with low integration TRL

    + Remove VOM for FTF, not reported in many sources and DEA numbers not reproduceable with original source
  - Methanolisation:

  - Ammonia cracker:
    + Mixed existing/new technology with existing large plants (for different purpose)
    + Consider plant size: Higher scale up based on previously considered reference with expected economies of scale
  - H2 liquefaction:
    + Consider larger plant sizes based on recent IRENA report leading to economies of scale
    + added: lower 2050 value
    + Match plant size to other similar facility sizes (LOHC hydrogenation) in repository
  - H2 evaporation:
    + Previous value for very small-scale dispensing station
    + Consider larger plant sizes based on recent IRENA report leading to economies of scale
    + added: lower 2050 value
    + Match plant size to other similar facility sizes (LOHC dehydrogenation) in repository
  - LOHC hydrogenation:
    + Small change in investment value due to change in caluclation method
  - LOHC dehydrogenation:
    + Same calulcation method as LOHC hydrogenation applied
    + Larger facility considered with resulting economies of scale
    + Distinguishing between "LOHC dehydrogenation (small scale)" e.g. a hydrogen refueling station,
      and "LOHC dehydrogenation" for large scale applications like large scale hydrogen imports
  - Haber-Bosch:
    + Use numbers based on DEA
  - air separation unit:
    + Use numbers based on DEA from Haber-Bosch ammonia plant for consistency
  - CH4 liquefaction:

    + Add correct source attribution
  - HVDC overhead:
    + Add correct source attribution
  - HVDC inverter pair:
    + Add correct source attribution

Technology-Data 0.3.0 (1 October 2021)
===========================================

This release includes several new technologies (see list below), the possibility
to easily add a new technology via a manual input and an update of the H2
Electrolysis assumptions.

It is released to coincide with `PyPSA-Eur-Sec <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur-sec>`_ Version 0.6.0, and is known to work with this release.

Features in more detail:

**New**:
  - update offshore wind assumptions according to DEA release in March 2022
  - update solar PV assumptions according to DEA release in Februrary 2022

* new technologies:

  - solar-rooftop residential
  - solar-rooftop commercial
  - seawater desalination (SWRO)
  - clean water tank storage
  - industrial heat pump for medium process temperatures
  - H2 and CH4 pipelines and compressors
  - shipping of CH4 (l), NH3 (l), LOHC, MeOH and H2 (l), Fischer-Tropsch
  - H2 liquefaction and evaporation
  - LOHC liquefication, hydrogenation and dehydrogenation
  - NH3 production (Haber-Bosch synthesis and air separation unit)
  - Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
  - costs for SMR (methane and methanol) and ammonia cracking
  - home battery storage and
  - CO2 pipeline
  - costs for retrofitting CH4 pipelines to H2 pipelines
* new function to adjust the investment costs according to the inflation. This is based on in the ``config.yaml`` specified rate of inflation and considered year
* new option to allow manual input via an additional csv file ``inputs/manual_inputs.csv``
* update of the H2 electrolyser assumptions based on new DEA release
* rudimentary CI and templates for pull requests and issues
* update of the latex tables for displaying the technology data


**Bugfixes**:

* adjust battery inverter lifetime to DEA footnote
* unit consistency, typos

Technology-Data 0.2.0 (11th December 2020)
===========================================

This release allows to include uncertainty bounds from the Danish Energy Agency (DEA), fixes inconsistencies with the handling of combined heat and power plants, and includes the latest data from the DEA on carbon capture technologies.

It is released to coincide with `PyPSA-Eur <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur>`_ Version 0.3.0 and `PyPSA-Eur-Sec <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur-sec>`_ Version 0.4.0, and is known to work with these releases.

Features in more detail:

* Using the ``expectation`` parameter in ``config.yaml`` you can control whether the upper and lower uncertainty bounds on technology parameters are read in from the DEA datasets.
* The biomass and gas combined heat and power (CHP) parameters ``c_v`` and ``c_b`` were read in assuming they were extraction plants rather than back pressure plants. The data is now corrected and they are implemented in PyPSA-Eur-Sec Version 0.4.0 with a fixed ratio of electricity to heat output. The old assumptions underestimated the heat output.
* The updated assumptions from the DEA for carbon capture technologies have been incorporated, including direct air capture and post-combustion capture on CHPs, cement kilns and other industrial facilities. These are then used in PyPSA-Eur-Sec Version 0.4.0.


Technology-Data 0.1.0 (21st August 2020)
========================================

This is the first release to coincide with the release of `PyPSA-Eur-Sec <https://github.com/PyPSA/pypsa-eur-sec>`_ Version 0.2.0.
